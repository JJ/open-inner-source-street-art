                        <aside class="notes">In this activity organized here in
                    2016, called "HackTheWall", organized by the open source lab
                    at the university of Granada (of which I was the head) and a
                    touring thing called CirCoLab, we made two street artists
                    collaborate with hardware and software hackers, creating a
                    couple of amazing graffiti that were interactive and took a
                            day of work by a rather big and eclectic
                    group. Because hackatons/jams break silos, barriers between
                    disciplines, but also across skill levels; you see my
                    daughter there, who was 17 then and is now a software
                    engineer in a company called Clarivate, and she's learning
                    from Nake, a well-established street artist and illustrator;

                        coordinate to create "walls of fame" or simply join in

                        where they want to. This ls LJDA, los Jinetes del

                        very good vibes in these jams, but also the quality
                        reached by individual components through their
                        interaction. Same happens with successful open source
                        projects: they are self-sustaining, and improve with

                    that you need to pay some git developers, as Booking does,
